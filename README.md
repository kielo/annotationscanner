# Annotation Scanner

Lightweight wrapper around bare [Infomas ASL Annotation Detector](https://github.com/rmuller/infomas-asl) that solves
common cases like extracting Method objects or loading Classes after they have been found by detector.


Version 0.1.0, although released, should be used with care. Code itself has no tests, as it was taken out from
[SmartParam engine](http://smartparam.org) and has lots of integration tests there. Future release will contain native
tests.
